}
\arguments{
\item{object}{(For default) cell embedding}

\item{assay}{(For Seurat) user choose the assay data they want to build a MST based on, can be RNA, ADT, Joint or All (All means calculate all three)}

\item{pg.nodes}{parameter for computing Ecipal Graph. number of nodes you want to build PG. if NULL, we will calculated a number based on your data size}

\item{pg.min.nodes}{parameter for computing Elastic Principal Graph. min value of pg.nodes}

\item{pg.Lambda}{parameter for computing Elastic Principal Graph, real, the lambda parameter used the compute the elastic energy}

\item{pg.Mu}{parameter for computing Elastic Principal Graph, real, the lambda parameter used the compute the elastic energy}

\item{trimming.radius}{parameter for computing Elastic Principal Graph, real, maximal distance of point from a node to affect its embedment}

\item{final.energy}{parameter for computing Elastic Principal Graph, string indicating the final elastic emergy associated with the configuration. Currently it can be "Base" or "Penalized"}

\item{initial.MST}{use MST as initial for PG or not. default is FALSE because use MST as initial is time consuming for large dataset}

\item{mst}{(For default) MST for building PG}
}
\description{
build PG based on user's choice (RNA, ADT, Joint or All) MST
